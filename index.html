                    <p>'Cum On Feel The Noize' solo by Quiet Riot</p>
                    <p>In 1983, American heavy metal band Quiet Riot covered the song originally recorded by Slade.
                        <br> Their version went on to reach No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1983 and helped their album Metal Health become a number-one hit.
                        <br> The song's success drew huge nationwide attention to the 1980s Los Angeles metal scene and also helped to break Slade belatedly in the US in 1984, after signing a deal with CBS.
                        <br> The song was certified gold by the RIAA. In 2002, Quiet Riot's version of "Cum On Feel the Noize" was ranked No. 80 on VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders.
                        <br> In 2009, VH1 also ranked it No. 41 of the "best hard rock songs of all time".</p>
